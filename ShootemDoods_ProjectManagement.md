# 1. Vision

# 3. Configuration Management  
## i. Overview of GitHub Management    
Per Professor Nash's requirements, the version control that our team used was GitHub. Most of our team has past experience with GitHub so being required to use it was not problematic for us. The team member with the most GitHub experience was Jacob Hinton so he took on the role of managing the repository by merging branches and fixing coding conflicts when they appeared.  

## ii. Utilization of the Branching Feature  
The ability to create and merge branches was a feature of GitHub that our team relied heavily upon. To elaborate, it allowed our programming team to create separate branches for each of our features and our art team to create their own art assets branch, thereby greatly minimizing any coding conflicts. Also, working on a branch that was separate from the master branch prevented us from catastrophically breaking any of the code.  

## iii. Creating the Documentation  
All of the official documentation for *Shootem Doods* that we posted on GitHub was done in GitHub-flavored Markdown. In the beginning, learning GitHub-flavored Markdown was a bit of a challenge for our documentation group. However, the text editor Atom (which is made by GitHub) proved to be a great help. The most helpful feature of Atom is its ability to recognize GitHub-flavored Markdown and that it allows you to preview the rendered text before uploading it to GitHub.

## i. Team Style  
The team style that our group decided to go with was the egoless approach. However, we did spit our team up into the following subgroups:  
  1. Programming Team  
    + Jacob Hinton  
    + Brandon Kilpatrick  
    + David Xu  
  2. Art/Design Team  
    + Steven Chase Bernard  
    + Brandon Kilpatrick    
  3. Documentation Team  
    + Elise Falgout  
    + Jonah Knickles
