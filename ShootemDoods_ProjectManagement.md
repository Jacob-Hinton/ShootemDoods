# 1. Vision
# 2. Process Model
# 3. Configuration Management  
## i. Overview of GitHub Management    
Per Professor Nash's requirements, the version control that our team used was GitHub. Most of our team has past experience with GitHub so being required to use it was not problematic for us. The team member with the most GitHub experience was Jacob Hinton so he took on the role of managing the repository by merging branches and fixing coding conflicts when they appeared.  

## ii. Utilization of the Branching Feature  
The ability to create and merge branches was a feature of GitHub that our team relied heavily upon. To elaborate, it allowed our programming team to create separate branches for each of our features and our art team to create their own art assets branch, thereby greatly minimizing any coding conflicts. Also, working on a branch that was separate from the master branch prevented us from catastrophically breaking any of the code.  

## iii. Creating the Documentation  
All of the official documentation for *Shootem Doods* that we posted on GitHub was done in GitHub-flavored Markdown. In the beginning, learning GitHub-flavored Markdown was a bit of a challenge for our documentation group. However, the text editor Atom (which is made by GitHub) proved to be a great help. The most helpful feature of Atom is its ability to recognize GitHub-flavored Markdown and that it allows you to preview the rendered text before uploading it to GitHub.

## i. Team Style  
The team style that our group decided to go with was the egoless approach. However, we did spit our team up into the following subgroups:  
  1. Programming Team  
    + Jacob Hinton  
    + Brandon Kilpatrick  
    + David Xu  
  2. Art/Design Team  
    + Steven Chase Bernard  
    + Brandon Kilpatrick    
  3. Documentation Team  
    + Elise Falgout  
    + Jonah Knickles  

## ii. Individual Contributions  
The following subsections talk about each team member's specific contribution to *Shootem Doods* and which team meetings they attended.
___
### a. Steven Chase Bernard  
___  

* Created art assets such as the player and enemies, as well as UI art elements
* Created animation frames for power-up abilities
* Helped with initial framework

___
### b. Elise Falgout  
___  
My main role in the development of *Shootem Doods* was in the creation of its documentation. More specifically, I did the following:  
  + Software Requirements Specification Document (SRS)  
    - Section 2: Overall Description  
      I wrote this section in a Word document and sent it to Jonah Knickles via email so he could convert it into Markdown.
    - Section 3: External Interface Requirements  
      I wrote this section in a Word document and sent it to Jonah Knickles via email so he could convert it into Markdown. Also, please note that I outlined which images I wanted shown under 3.1 User Interfaces and that Brandon Kilpatrick and Jacob Hinton actually took the images because they had access to the most current version of the game.  
    - Added more references   
    - Proof read the final document   
  + Software Testing Document (STD)  
    - Formatted the document  
    - Section 1: Introduction  
      I wrote the Document Conventions subsection  
    - Section 2: Functional Requirements Test Cases  
      I wrote all of the test cases under subsections x. Game Over - xx. Save High Score. These subsections correspond to the functional requirements FR-10 through FR-20 that were outlined in our SRS document.  
    - Proof read the final document  
  + Project Management Document  
    - Formatted the document  
    - Section 3: Configuration Management  
      I wrote this entire section.  
    - Section 6: Team Members  
      I wrote the subsection i. Team Style and the introduction to subsection ii. Individual Contributions.

* Contributed to the SRS document, notably on the functional requirements

___
### d. Brandon Kilpatrick  
___  

___
### e. Jonah Knickles
