# 1.  Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
This document shall outline the requirments for the PC game "Shootem Doods". It shall inform of the functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, scope, constraints, and development process.


## 1.2 Document Conventions
This Document adheres to IEEE standards 830-1998. Within this document, all requirement statements have their own priority. 


## 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended to be read by the developers of the software, managers of the project, the client, and any stakeholders of the "Shootem Doods" software system.


## 1.4 Scope
"Shootem Doods" is a Unity based side scrolling shooter for the PC. It shall have multiple levels with branching paths, some of which have "Boss" Enemies at the end. The game is intended to be moderately difficult at minimum, with some paths increasing the difficulty. This increases replay value, which should improve the user's experience. The game should be free to download once built.


"Shootem doods" will be able to detect user inputs from both keyboards, or XInput controllers. The software, once acquired, should not need an internet connection to run. "Shootem Doods" will have conditions for both victory and defeat. Each condition will show the user a series of messages before returning them to the main menu screen.
