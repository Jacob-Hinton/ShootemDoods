A scrolling shooter programmed in unity

this game was inspired by gradius and seeks to recreate its fun while also building on its base.

The main draw of this game is its color based power system. It has three power up colors

* red
* yellow
* blue

and each can go into one of three power up slots. When acquiring power ups the amount of each color you have will affect what
power up you receive with up to ten different combinations.

The game supports keyboard and Xinput controls and the proper control mappings are found in the controls menu on the start screen.

the collaborators on the project are as follows

* Jacob Hinton
* Brandon Kilpatrick
* Chase Bernard
* David Xu
* Elise Falgout
* Jonah Knickles
